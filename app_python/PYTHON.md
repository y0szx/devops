## Why to use Flask for web applications

I used `Flask` framework for this task because:

* it is highly scalable which is perfect for creating a web application step by step;
* it has a clear documentation and therefore easy to use;
* it has a massive user base among the tech community;
* it is lightweight and flexible.

### Best practices applied:

* The code is formatted using `autopep8` formatter and is following `PEP8` standards;
* all dependencies are installed using `venv` to avoid installation of Python packages globally;
* the application is tested to ensure that displayed time updates upon page refreshing.
