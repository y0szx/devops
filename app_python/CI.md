# CI best practices

## Job Organization

The YAML file organizes jobs into logical sections for better readability and maintainability.

## Cache Management

Dependencies are cached (~/.cache/pip) to speed up builds and reduce the load on package repositories.

## Environment Isolation

Each job runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that they don't interfere with each other and allowing for
parallel execution.

## Secrets Management

Docker Hub credentials and Snyk token are stored as secrets `(${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}, ${{
secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}, ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }})`, ensuring security and preventing sensitive information from
being exposed.
